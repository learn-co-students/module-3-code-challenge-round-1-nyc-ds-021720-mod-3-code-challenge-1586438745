The goal of machine learning, and in this case linear regression, is to develop a model that is as accurate as possible, meaning the line predicts y values with as little difference or error from the actual values (for a supervised model where the actuals are known).  To determine the line of best fit, we must first determine how the line should be angled (the slope) so it has the smallest RSS.  The cost curve helps us determine that m value by identifying the lowest point in the cost curve where the RSS is the lowest.  Fore xample, according to the graph above that m value would be approximately .05."
